Developer notes:
---------------


SPAWNVPN is a linux process to invoke the openvpn in linux.rac for Clearpath Networks Business Cloud solutions.
It is designed to run openvpn for linux.rac. Currently the spawnvpn image is added to Ubuntu debian package for linux.rac.

User gets a spawnvpn image and copied to debian package building directroy(linux.rac) which needs to be build with linux RAC.


Requirements for Development Environment:
-----------------------------------------
Development system should run with gcc(GNU)




Steps to Configure and Build spawnvpn:
--------------------------------------
Needs to get spawnvpn check out from github as below
git clone https://username:password@github.com/clearpath-networks/spawnvpn.git
move to the spawnvpn directory
make distclean
./configure
make
we will get the spawnvpn image in the path spawnvpn/src/spawnvpn


spawnvpn Image:
--------------
The spawnvpn image can build on different architecture 32bit as well 64bit.
currently we are building with amd64(64bit) and i386(32bit) on different flavours of Ubuntu
spawnvpn Image must be replaced based on target architecture to the linx.rac directory.




TODO:
----
1) Need to add spawnvpn with linux.rac on the firmware build process
